## Story

3D 3rd-person-camera running/dodging down pathways.

Instead of scripted movement, I am doing a free-input movement 

Powerups are obtainable throughout the level; Certain powerups are for certain pathways (Jumping powerup is used during a high jump pathway)


**Examples**

Examples of some games with some related concepts:

 * Subway Surfers
 * Tomb Runner
 * Fall Guys
